# Postman-to-k6

Converts a [Postman collections](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections) to [k6 script](https://docs.k6.io/docs).

The transformer converts Postman requests and [variables](http://blog.getpostman.com/2014/02/20/using-variables-inside-postman-and-collection-runner/) into k6 requests and variables respectively.

Postman [pre-requests](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/pre_request_scripts) and [tests](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/writing_tests) are appended as comments before and after its respective k6 request. The pre-request and test behaviour could easily be replicated with the [K6 API](https://docs.k6.io/docs/k6).
